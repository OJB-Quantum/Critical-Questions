A table of terms that can generally be asked face-to-face or entered into a browser search bar to return useful and critical information in various formats. (I compiled this table from a list developed over a number of years through trial and error and thinking of ways to identify loopholes in reality, to some extent).

This can be used to inspire a way to ask critical questions as well, towards the goal of comprehensive understanding and idea/ context generation for enhanced learning/ research. By finding better answers to more of each question or query from the table below, more context can be gained about a topic.

http://www.acgov.org/searchhelp.htm is a nice starting point, but not the end. The table I created below can be viewed as supplementary.
Additionally, a careful sequence of searches based on the list can be performed using ethical web scraping libraries if needed, examples provided in here.

| Key |
|-----------------------|
| (__) : Blank term, enter desired keyword. |
| (-) : Subtracts a word from search to narrow down a search. |
| (-)"(__)" : Subtracts an exact phrase from search. |
| "" : Use quotation marks to group words together. |
| OR : Allows simultaneous search of multiple terms. |
