A list of terms that can be entered into a Google search bar (https://www.google.com/search?q=) and return results that provide useful and critical information in various formats. (I compiled this list over a number of years through trial and error).


http://www.acgov.org/searchhelp.htm is a good starting point, but also not the end. Therefore, the list I created below can be viewed supplementary.
