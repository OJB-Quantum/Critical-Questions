# Critical Questions (Keywords & Terms)

A table of terms that can generally be asked face-to-face or entered into a browser search bar to return useful and critical information in various formats. This can be used to inspire a way to ask critical questions as well, towards the goal of comprehensive understanding and idea/ context generation for enhanced learning/ research. By finding better answers to more of each question or query from the table below, more context can be gained about a topic of one's interest.

(I developed this table from a list compiled over a number of years, developing a way to help identify loopholes in physics and learning experiences).

## Things to Consider:
- When it comes to an idea, you must consider whether the information is physically significant or not and to make that distinction. If something is only mathematically important, then it may only be relevant to navigating to the right ideas.
- Determine if the information being sought or offered is abstract or concrete and to what extent or level of. (Abstract: multiple meanings or intangible; concrete: more or less a specific meaning or tangible).
- Determine the topic level of subjectivity.
- If the initial question does not completely make sense, ask for more information.
- Whenever you have a "finite set", you can always find the "maximum of that set".
- In a sense, time is like a continous multilayer of translucent or transparent filters, which old ideas are able to pass through. As we move further along, old ideas can overlap with new ones and form new prospects or designs. This gives birth to continuous iteration. 
- Get comfortable with automating mundane tasks, but prepared to do some temporarily manual work.
- When you are simply curious about something and you happen to meet a legitimate expert, always clarify up front that you are seeking to satisfy a curiosity. The reality is that people, especially in the scientific community, tend to assume that you are trying to sell them something or convince them of something, when approached. This consideration may make the exchange easier.
- Attribution of descriptors or adjectives as pre-terms before the actual use of a word helps with clarity. Ex: excitatory stimulation with high KCl delivery. Another ex: inhibitory stimulation with TTX delivery.

[searchhelp.htm](http://www.acgov.org/searchhelp.htm) is a nice starting point, but not the end. The table below can be viewed as supplementary to this.
Additionally, a careful sequence of searches based on the list can be performed using ethical web scraping libraries if needed, examples provided in here.

| Key |
|-----------------------|
| (__) : Blank term, enter desired keyword. |
| (-) : Subtracts a word from search to narrow down a search. |
| (-)"(__)" : Subtracts an exact phrase from search. |
| "" : Use quotation marks to group words together. |
| OR : Allows simultaneous search of multiple terms. |
